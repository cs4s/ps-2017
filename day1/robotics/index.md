# Writing Algorithms with Mindstorms Robots

## About

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. You could say that whenever you cook a meal by following a recipe, you are performing an algorithm.
When Computer Scientists and Software Engineers write code, they must write algorithms to instruct a computer how to perform a task. 
Writing algorithms is an essential part of Computer Science and Coding, as computers only understand precise and explicit instructions. 
Algorithms make everything you do with digital technologies possible, for example: checking your emails, finding someoneâ€™s house with a GPS or finding information on Google.

In this session you will learn about writing algorithms with Mindstorms robots.
