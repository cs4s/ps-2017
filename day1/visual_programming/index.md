# Visual Programming with Scratch

## About

In this session we will learn about Visual Programming with Scratch. 
Visual Programming is a way of writing code graphically, rather than with text. 
Scratch is a Visual Programming language that can be used to create interactive stories, animations and games.

We recommend you start with the *Introduction to Scratch* tutorial before completing the *Making Cookie Bird* tutorial, both of which are linked below.
