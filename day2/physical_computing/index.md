# Physical Computing with MaKey MaKeys

## About
In this session we will work through some hands-on activities using Scratch and MaKey MaKeys. 
These activities combine Visual Programming & Physical Computing concepts.

**Physical Computing** usually refers to designing and developing computer hardware and software that involves some physical interaction or the use of sensors.
This physical interaction could be a different way of interacting with the computer, that may not involve using a mouse and keyboard.
For example, playing a game, such as [Dance Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-iKWe-U9bY){:target="_blank"} that involves dancing in front of a camera with a motion sensor.
Sensors are also often used to collect data from the "real world", for example: temperature, humidity and noise levels.

In this session we will focus on making programs that involve alternative forms of physical interaction (i.e. not using a keyboard and mouse).

You may have heard of [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} or [Rasbperry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"}.
These are both small, cheap computers that can be used in a variety of Physical Computing projects.
In this session we will be using MaKey MaKeys, which you could say are a simpler version of these.
MaKey MaKeys are ["An Invention Kit for Everyone"](http://makeymakey.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

The increased availability of gadgets like MaKey MaKeys and 3D printers has spurred on the ["Maker Movement"](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28408/maker-movement){:target="_blank"}.
This is encouraging for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, because being a Maker usually involves using skills from all of these these disciplines to create a real, tangible invention.
